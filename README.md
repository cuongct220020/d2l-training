# Deep Learning

## Introduction
- This repository follows the guidance from **[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)** and integrates knowledge and exercises from the university course **[IT4663 - Deep Learning Application](./it4663/)**.  
- All notebooks are designed to run on **Google Colab** and implemented using **PyTorch**. With **Google Colab**, you can easily open notebooks directly from GitHub, select a **GPU** runtime, and run the cells step by step â€” all in just a few clicks.
